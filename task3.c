Assignment task 3

The program above displays an interactive menu that a patient can use to book an appointment with their GP, extend existing prescriptions or print test results.

    a. Comment the existing code.
    b. Write the code for:
        i. booking an appointment with the GP. The user should be asked to enter the GP name, date and time they want the appointment for.
        ii. extending existing prescriptions. The user should be asked to enter the prescription identifier they want to extend. The prescription identifier is a number.
        iii. printing test results. The user should be asked to enter the test result identifier they want to print. The test result identifier is a number.

Please note that some variables are already declared for you but you might need to more.

    c. Check if the option entered by the user is valid. It should be a number between 0 and 3. Print a message if itâ€™s not valid.
    d. Extend the code to ask the user for how many days they want to extend the prescriptions for.
    e. Change the code to allow the test prescription and test result identifiers to be strings.

Marking scheme:
	1 mark for presenting the program in week 5.
	Up to 5 marks for items a. and b.
	Up to 4 marks for items c, d, e.
	You need to do items a. and b. before approaching items c, d and e.
