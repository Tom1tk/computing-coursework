Assignment task 7

Write a piece of code that asks the user to input any number of temperatures and store them in an array.
    1. Find a certain temperature entered by the user in the array and display a message saying if the temperature was found or not.
    2. Display the position where the temperature is found in the array.
    3. Delete the temperature if it is found in the array.

Marking scheme:
	1 mark for presenting the program in week 9.
	4 marks for item 1.
	2 marks for item 2.
	3 marks for item 3.

Example:
How many temperatures to enter? 5
Temperatures stored in the array: 18 23 24 25 13
Temperature to find: 24
The temperature 24 is found in the array
The temperature 24 is found in the array on position 2
The array of temperatures after 24 is deleted: 18 23 25 13

Example:
How many temperatures to enter? 5
Temperatures stored in the array: 18 23 24 25 13
Temperature to find: 20
The temperature 20 is not found in the array
The temperature 20 is not found in the array
The array of temperatures remains the same: 18 23 24 25 13
